Greatest basketball players ever according to me:

* Jordan
   Greatest player in terms of image and status. Brought the game to international stage. 6-6 in the finals (which is a team accomplishment but still impressive.)
* Lebron
   Best player to ever touch a basketball. Physical dominance, technical wizardry, unparalleled longevity, greatest scorer of baskets in the game called basketball.
* Kareem
* Magic
* Shaq
* Kobe
* Bird
* Wilt
* Tim Duncan
* Steph

Come back in a bit and Luka will probably be on this list...
